## Evaluation

After you submit your code, we will review it and get back to you. Then, you'll have the opportunity to explain your code and share your thoughts, and we may ask you additional questions. You don't necessarily have to complete everything. It's sufficient if you explain how you approach the problem and the thoughts behind it. This helps us understand and evaluate your approach. Therefore, remember to comment your code well.
